## <a name="Nexus"></a>Nexus
A physical entity (P) mediating (M) two or more other entities. Each [nexus](#Nexus) is a bundle of prehensions, which may be the junctures of an [object](#Object) or the participants of a [process](#Process). Examples include an arch that consists of junctures of stones or an action that consists of what one participant called an agent is doing to another participant called a patient.

## <a name="Process"></a>Process
Actuality (IP) considered as an [occurrent](#Occurrent) (O) during the interval of interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable [object](#Object) or a dynamic [process](#Process). Even an entity as stable as a diamond could be considered a [process](#Process) when viewed over a long time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.

    <p>
Intention (MA) that has the form of an [occurrent](#Occurrent) (O). As an example, the words and notes of the song &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; constitute a [script](#Script) (IAO); a [description](#Description) of how people at a party sang the song is [history](#History) (RAO); and the [intention](#Intention) (MA) that explains the [situation](#Situation) (MPO) is a [purpose](#Purpose) (MAO). The basic axioms for [Purpose](#Purpose) are inherited from its supertypes Mediating, Abstract, and [Occurrent](#Occurrent). Lower-level axioms relate purposes to actions and agents:

    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
&#160;

      </p>

      <li>
<i>Time sequence</i>. If an agent <i>x</i> performs an act <i>y</i> whose [purpose](#Purpose) is a [situation](#Situation) <i>z</i>, the start of <i>y</i> occurs before the start of <i>z</i>.
        <p>
&#160;

        </p>


      </li>
      <li>
<i>Contingency</i>. If an agent <i>x</i> performs an act <i>y</i> whose [purpose](#Purpose) is a [situation](#Situation) <i>z</i> described by a proposition <i>p</i>, then it is possible that <i>z</i> might not occur or that <i>p</i> might not be true of <i>z</i>.
        <p>
&#160;

        </p>


      </li>
      <li>
<i>Success or failure</i>. If an agent <i>x</i> performs an act <i>y</i> whose [purpose](#Purpose) is a [situation](#Situation) <i>z</i> described by a proposition <i>p</i>, then <i>x</i> is said to be <i>successful</i> if <i>z</i> occurs and <i>p</i> is true of <i>z</i>; otherwise, <i>x</i> is said to have <i>failed</i>.

    <p>
A form (IA) that has the structure of an [occurrent](#Occurrent) (O). A [script](#Script) is an abstract form (IA) that represents time sequences. Examples include computer programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be played on a piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution of a physical [process](#Process). A movie can be described by several different kinds of scripts: the first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also a [script](#Script) that determines a [process](#Process) carried out by a projector that generates flickering images on a screen.
